Notes from editors: "focusing more on research articles, so we would ask for a more extended paper that also includes, for example, a more in depth critique of proprietary/private semantic and knowledge management systems and how these keep closing off access to climate knowledge and from there how your case study of the Climate Knowledge Graph proposes an intervention into this. Would that work?

We would also suggest using a different format for your abstract than what you have submitted as JEP abstracts mostly follow a more descriptive 200-300 word format providing an overview of research questions and arguments made. Do have a look at previous issues for examples of this, if this is helpful."
